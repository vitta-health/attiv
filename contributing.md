# Contributing to Attiv

_See also: [Attiv's code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)_

## Welcome

We invite you to join our team! Everyone is welcome to contribute code
via pull requests, to file issues on GitHub, to help people asking for
help on our mailing lists, or on Stack Overflow, to
help triage, reproduce, or fix bugs that people have filed, to add to our
documentation, or to help out in any other way.

We communicate primarily over Github issues but you can send and email to opensource@vitta.me at any time;

## Helping out in the issue database

If you want to help us triage, you are very welcome to do so!

1. Read [our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly
   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. If you're helping out
   with triage, you are representing the Flutter team, and so you want to make sure to
   make a good impression!

2. Help out as described in our wiki: https://github.com/attiv/attiv/wiki/Triage
   You won't be able to add labels at first, so instead start by trying to
   do the other steps, e.g. trying to reproduce the problem and asking for people to
   provide enough details that you can reproduce the problem, pointing out duplicates,
   and so on.

3. Familiarize yourself with our
   [issue hygiene](https://github.com/attiv/attiv/wiki/Issue-hygiene) wiki page,
   which covers the meanings of some important GitHub labels and
   milestones.
